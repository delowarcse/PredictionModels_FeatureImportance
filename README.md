# PredictionModels_FeatureImportance
This code is the implementation of calculating feature importance of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models using Cross Validation

# Feature Importance
Definition: Feature Importance refers to techniques that calculate a score for all the input features for a given model — the scores simply represent the “importance” of each feature. A higher score means that the specific feature will have a larger effect on the model that is being used to predict a certain variable.
